{"body":" a biologically inspired grayscale/SO/DO GIST model for scene categorization\r\n===============\r\n\r\nGIST model was original proposed in:\r\nOliva, A., Torralba, A.: Modeling the shape of the scene : A holistic representation\r\nof the spatial envelope.IJCV, 2001.\r\n\r\ndemoRelease  : grayscale Gist\r\ndemoSoRelease: SOGist \r\ndemoDoRelease: DOGist\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFiltering in the original algorithm was done in the frequency domain. We thus had to design\r\nfilters in the spatial domain that would approximate the original system as best as possible. \r\nIn practice, we found that the Gabor \ffilter parameters used in the\r\nHMAX model with six scales (7x7 to 39x39 in steps of 6 pixels), two phases\r\n(0 and 90 degrees), and eight orientations (0-180 degrees in steps of 22.5 degrees) led to results\r\ncomparable to those obtained with the grayscale Gist model.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you use this code, please cite:\r\nZhang J., Barhomi Y., and Serre T.
