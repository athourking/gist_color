%function [c1,s1] = C1(stim, filters, fSiz, c1SpaceSS, c1ScaleSS, c1OL,INCLUDEBORDERS)
%
%  A matlab implementation of the C1 code originally by Max Riesenhuber
%  and Thomas Serre.
%  Adapted by Stanley Bileschi
%
%  Returns the C1 and the S1 units' activation given the
%  input image, stim.
%  filters, fSiz, c1ScaleSS, c1ScaleSS, c1OL, INCLUDEBORDERS are the
%  parameters of the C1 system
%
%  stim   - the input image must be grayscale (single channel) and
%   type ''double''
%
%%% For S1 unit computation %%%
%
% filters -  Matrix of Gabor filters of size max_fSiz x num_filters,
% where max_fSiz is the length of the largest filter and num_filters the
% total number of filters. Column j of filters matrix contains a n_jxn_j
% filter (reshaped as a column vector and padded with zeros).
%
% fSiz - Vector of size num_filters containing the various filter
% sizes. fSiz(j) = n_j if filters j is n_j x n_j (see variable filters
% above).
%
%%% For C1 unit computation %%%
%
% c1ScaleSS  - Vector defining the scale bands, i.e. a group of filter
% sizes over which a local max is taken to get the C1 unit responses,
% e.g. c1ScaleSS = [1 k num_filters+1] means 2 scale bands, the first
% one contains filters(:,1:k-1) and the second one contains
% filters(:,k:num_filters). If N pooling bands, c1ScaleSS should be of
% length N+1.
%
% c1SpaceSS - Vector defining the spatial pooling range for each scale
% band, i.e. c1SpaceSS(i) = m_i means that each C1 unit response in band
% i is obtained by taking a max over a local neighborhood of m_ixm_i S1
% units. If N bands then c1SpaceSS should be of size N.
%
% c1OL - Scalar value defining the overlap between C1 units. In scale
% band i, the C1 unit responses are computed every c1Space(i)/c1OL.
%
% INCLUDEBORDERS - the type of treatment for the image borders.
